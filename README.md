## Description
YAT is a `terminal emulator` written entirely in JavaScript using [`preact`](https://github.com/developit/preact), a `react-like` library to create reactive user interfaces(UIs). To manage our data we use [`mobx`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) for its semplicity and event-less flow of information. YAT provides by default a simple UI that can be extended with themes and plugins, making the terminal experience up to your immagination. YAT is a place where the tense `If You can think of something You can do it` is actually true. 100% hackable, 100% open source, 100% yours.
